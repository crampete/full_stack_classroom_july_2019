## Learning Hacks

- Inspect and modify elements of web pages. Take note of CSS as well.
- Read random codepens everyday. Will just take 5 minutes. Examples
  - https://codepen.io/tag/beginner/
- Read source code of FreeCodeCamp projects. Examples
  - Google FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page for various projects. Example [1](https://codepen.io/leroybm/pen/YVLGBL) and [2](https://codepen.io/abhirath/pen/RKeaWM).
  - Google other FreeCodeCamp project submissions as well. I want you guys to explore FreeCodeCamp and thus will refrain from posting direct links :)
- FreeCodeCamp exercises whenever free. Each takes like 1 minute.
- [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) Build 30 things using Pure JavaScript. Super fun. Try doing two every week.

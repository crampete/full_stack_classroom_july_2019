## Basic Goals

Our main goal is to get you people to understand the big ideas and the core concepts in as many areas as possible.

Most importantly we want to get rid of the resistance between you and code and enable you to address issues and bugs by yourself.

## Extended Goals

If you are already comfortable programming, apart from these basic goals we want you to understand our code, add features to it, read and compare it with code written by other people.

## Result

To accomplish the above we've resorted to open ended projects which will cater to the needs of all. After explanation of the very basic stuff, people who are new to programming should try understanding and replicating the same. Those who are already comfortable are encouraged to add new features that they seem fit.

Many a times there are numerous ways to doing the same thing. We've intentionally taken a particular way to explain some concept. Also to save time and avoid repetition we won't cover each and every way of doing the same thing. For instance I was asked why did I choose to use `document.getElementById()` instead of `document.querySelector()`. Like I explained the other day it has the additional burden of learning the rules and syntax that come with it. The time doesn't justify the learning value. Moreover in real life we would probably use `jQuery` or `React`.

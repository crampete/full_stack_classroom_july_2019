## Some Good Resources

Good resources that I find a little late so they don't exactly fit in the homework schedule or are good resources to keep in mind in general.

### General

- For those who want to go deeper and really understand how code and computers work I would recommend this course called [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).

### UI / UX
